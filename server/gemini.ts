Your task is to generate 3 UNIQUE, HIGH-QUALITY app ideas that can be built with Replit and sold on Whop.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIQUENESS:
- Generate COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ideas each time you're asked
- Think about EMERGING trends and UNDERSERVED niches
- Avoid repeating any ideas you've generated before
- Each idea must solve a DIFFERENT type of problem
- Use your knowledge of successful SaaS products, trending markets, and current technology

RESEARCH & ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Consider successful micro-SaaS products and Whop marketplace trends
2. Analyze current creator economy, automation, and productivity needs
3. Identify specific pain points in underserved markets
4. Think about tools that save time or make money for specific groups

Each app MUST:
- Solve a SPECIFIC, REAL problem that people will pay for ($20-$200/month)
- Be simple enough to build with AI tools in one focused session
- Have clear, immediate value for a specific audience
- Target a niche that's currently underserved
- Be unique and NOT a generic tool

AVOID these overused, generic ideas:
- Basic todo lists, note-taking apps, or habit trackers
- Simple calculators, converters, or basic dashboards
- Generic AI chatbots without specific, valuable use cases
- Social media post schedulers (too saturated)
- Simple form builders or survey tools

PRIORITIZE these high-value categories:
- Automation tools that save hours of manual work for specific jobs
- Tools that directly help people make money (e.g., for content creators, entrepreneurs, freelancers)
- Niche-specific analytics or insights tools for underserved industries
- Specialized tools for emerging platforms or communities
- Cross-platform integration tools that solve friction points
- Data extraction and processing tools for specific use cases

EXAMPLES OF GOOD IDEAS (for inspiration, but generate DIFFERENT ones):
- "Instagram Caption Generator for Local Businesses" - helps small business owners create engaging captions
- "Etsy Keyword Research Tool" - helps Etsy sellers find high-converting keywords
- "Discord Community Analytics" - tracks engagement metrics for community managers
- "TikTok Trend Alerter for Brands" - notifies brands of relevant trending sounds/hashtags

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
{
  "ideas": [
    {
      "name": "Specific, Catchy App Name (3-5 words)",
      "description": "Clear 2-3 sentence description explaining WHAT it does, WHO it helps, and the SPECIFIC BENEFIT they get",
      "targetAudience": "Very specific demographic with their pain point (e.g., 'Podcast hosts who struggle to create show notes and timestamps')",
      "features": ["Specific feature 1", "Specific feature 2", "Specific feature 3", "Specific feature 4"]
    }

- Freelance and gig economy tools
- Small business automation
- Content repurposing and distribution
- Niche data analysis and insights

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the actual prompt that should be pasted into Replit AI Builder. Do NOT include any introductory text like "Here's a prompt" or explanations. Start directly with the instructions for building the app.

The prompt should be concise and tell Replit AI to:
1. Build this app for Whop marketplace
2. Make it work with Whop's iframe and authentication
3. Follow Whop's official documentation (provide these links for Replit AI to reference):
   - https://docs.whop.com/apps/introduction
   - https://docs.whop.com/apps/getting-started
   - https://docs.whop.com/apps/app-views/experience-view
   - https://docs.whop.com/apps/building-apps
   - https://docs.whop.com/apps/tutorials
   - https://docs.whop.com/apps/get-api-key

Keep it simple - just describe the app requirements and reference the Whop docs. Let Replit AI figure out the technical implementation by reading the documentation.`;
